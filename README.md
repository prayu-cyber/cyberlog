# What I Learned: 

->Native vs Cross-Platform
I learned how Flutter allows building apps for Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop using a single codebase.  
Unlike native development (Kotlin for Android, Swift for iOS), Flutter compiles the same Dart code into apps that run on multiple platforms, saving time and keeping the UI consistent.

->Hot Reload
Flutter’s Hot Reload feature instantly reflects code changes in the running app.  
This helped me experiment with UI, fix small issues quickly, and understand how widgets behave without restarting the whole app.

->Widgets
Everything in Flutter is a widget—text, layouts, buttons, app bars, etc.  
I learned how widgets are combined to build the UI, and how `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Center`, and `Text` work together to create the screen.

4.Opened SDK Manager to install:

-Android SDK Platform

-Platform-Tools

-Emulator components

-Created an Android Virtual Device (AVD) using Device Manager.

-Created a new Flutter project and replaced the main.dart code.

5.Ran the app using:
